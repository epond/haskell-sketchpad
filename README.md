# Haskell Sketchpad

My experiments with the Haskell language.

The intended use is to look at the source and unit tests.

Build and run
-----

`cabal run` will build the module and run it. It may give a message telling you what dependencies need to be installed
first using `cabal install`.

`cabal test` will run the tests.

`cabal repl` will fire up a repl with the project loaded so you can do things like check types and generally poke around.
